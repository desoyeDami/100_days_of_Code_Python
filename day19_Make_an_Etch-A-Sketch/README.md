# Turtle Racing Game

Welcome to the Turtle Racing Game, a fun and interactive Python program where you can bet on your favorite turtle to win the race! The program simulates a race between colorful turtles, and you can place your bet on the winning turtle. Let's get started!

## How to Play

1. Run the game by executing the Python script.

2. A window will appear with six turtles lined up at the starting line, each with a different color: red, yellow, orange, green, blue, and purple.

3. A dialog will prompt you to make your bet. Enter the color of the turtle you think will win the race.

4. Once you've placed your bet, the race begins!

5. The turtles will move forward by random distances, and the first turtle to cross the finish line (x-coordinate > 230) wins the race.

6. If your chosen turtle wins, you'll receive a congratulatory message. Otherwise, you'll be informed that you lost.

7. Click anywhere on the game screen to exit the program.

- Python 3.x
